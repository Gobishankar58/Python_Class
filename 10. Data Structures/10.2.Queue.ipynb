    "__Queue__ is an abstract data type that follows the \"First-In-First-Out\" (FIFO) principle. It behaves like a real-world queue or line, where the first person who joins the queue is the first one to be served. In a queue, new elements are added to the back, and elements are removed from the front.\n",
